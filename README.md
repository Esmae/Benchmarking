# Benchmarking
Benchmarking different methods
- Benchmarking the Project January Linear Algebra tensorDotProduct
- Benchmarking the addition of two tensors
- Benchmarking the summation of tensors

* Trying to make changing the running benchmarks easier by passing arguments to update-gh.sh and the python scripts
* This copy hasn't been configured with Travis properly - will try to push to gh-pages
