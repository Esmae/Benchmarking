## What I've done:
..* Set up a maven project in java, store on GitHub
..* Wrote some new iterators for the summation, addition and tensor Dot Product of datasets/tensors, before and after they have been transposed.  Used junit testing to test my code.
..* Wrote benchmarks for my iterators and the original iterators in Eclipse January
..* Set up Travis CI so that it builds my project, runs the junit tests and if passses those will then run the benchmarking
..* Wrote some python scripts that are called after success in Travis  - store data and plot graphs, Travis then pushes back to GitHub

## Maven Project
### build automation tool, normally for Java projects
..* POM(Project Object Model): provides the configuration for the project
..* Using the maven shade plugin in the POM (need to put in)
..* Can change the <mainClass> tag so outputs the runnable class you want
..* Dependencies used:
...Junit: 4.12
...Jmh-core: 1.19
...Jmh-generator-annprocess: 1.19
...Org.eclipse.january: 2.0.2
..* *I remember having to delete something in the POM, as otherwise got lots of error messages in eclipse. I canâ€™t remember what it was but if having this problem, compare with my POM on GitHub.*
..* When run maven build, automatically runs the junit testing 

## GitHub
..* Github deletes empty directories
..* GitHub pages : Can have a repo for this (e.g. Esmae.github.io), can also have a page for each repo, with either the master or gh-pages branch set as the publishing source
